# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This web-based simulator demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round Robin (RR). Users can input process details, select an algorithm, and view results in a table and Gantt chart, with average turnaround and waiting times calculated.

## Features
- Input number of processes, burst time, and arrival time.
- Supports FCFS, SJF, SRTF, and RR (with time quantum).
- Displays output table with completion, turnaround, and waiting times.
- Visualizes scheduling via Gantt chart.
- Summarizes average turnaround and waiting times.

## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- (Optional) Local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for testing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Yahyaimthiyas/cpu-scheduling-simulator.git
